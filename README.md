## Test task "Shortly"
Hello! I present my version of the test task implementation.

The API [shrtcode API] provides many "short" links, but not all of them work.
I am displaying "shiny.link" links in the user interface, I tested these links and they work.
Validation is performed before sending the request to the server: 
validators: 'required', 'pattern'. 
After receiving data from the server, they are saved in Local Storage.

Looking forward to your response!
